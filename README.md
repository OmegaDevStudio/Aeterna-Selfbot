# Aeterna Selfbot
A selfbot made purely with [selfcord.py](https://github.com/Shell1010/Selfcord) a wrapper designed for selfbots. This was made for demonstration purposes, as a base example for your own projects.

## Usage
Create a config.json in the parent directory of the project folder. Then within it define the `token` and `prefixes` keys.

```json
{
    "token": "Your Token Here",
    "prefixes": ["!", "?"]
}
```
